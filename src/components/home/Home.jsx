    My name is :
    Volodymyr Trykoz
    I am a motivated, adaptable, and responsible web developer with over 2 years of experience in Front end.

    I have developed several Single Page Applications using such technologies as React, Redux, React-Hooks, React-Router, GraphQL, RestAPI, JavaScript, HTML, SCSS and others supporting libraries.

    I have created more than 30 web pages of different complexity using plain JavaScript, jQuery, WordPress, and supporting libraries such as GreenSock animation, ScrollMagic, MomentJs, and many others. Some of them, you can find here

    I have a good sense of style and an understanding of great UI/UX design. I have a result-focused approach to work and a strong drive to see things through to completion.

    Take some time to look at my work examples, and if you're interested, please contact me.
